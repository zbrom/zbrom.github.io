If you are using a Gmail account for all of your e-mail communications, you should definitely consider an alternative provider.  Google is utilizing your account as a [massive collection tool](https://www.techspot.com/news/80134-google-uses-receipts-sent-gmail-log-online-purchases.html){:target="_blank"}.  All of your purchase history, upcoming events, and connections are being data mined by their systems.  Additionally, they are using data obtained from your Gmail account to profile you for ads and marketing.  Additionally, the content contained in your messages is being shared with Google and potentially third parties as well.  There is becoming a growing need for alternatives to Google services, along with email providers that strive to protect individual privacy and offer some level of anonymity to their users. The following services are recommended by ghorr.  Additionally, ghorr recommends that all users take necessary precaution by encrypting all email messages using GPG or some other form of encryption.  Here is a [guide](../../arch/gpg){:target="_blank"} how to set up GPG encryption in Arch.
