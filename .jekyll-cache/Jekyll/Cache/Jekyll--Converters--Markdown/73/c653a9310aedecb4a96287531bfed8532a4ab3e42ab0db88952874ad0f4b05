I"Ú<p>Google Chrome has ultimately become the de facto web browser used by most individuals on both their computers and mobile devices.  Unfortunately, the browser is a massive data collection tool.  The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> reports that the browser delivered 11,000 tracker cookies in a single week.  Mozilla Firefox is not perfect, but at least <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-data-privacy-promise" target="_blank">their business model</a> does not depend on massive data collection.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, it has become imperative to ditch Google Chrome.  Their new tracking and data collection system, called Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) is designed to group individuals into cohorts based on their browsing history and interests for the purpose of delivering advertisements.</p>

<p>Another excellent technique to utilize is called browser isolation, where the user isolates particular services to a given browser (e.g., only loading Gmail from a Chromium browser).</p>
