I"Ó<p>This tutorial explains how to add a LiveCD as an entry for your GRUB menu. This is especially useful for backing up your boot drive, or when you may need to troubleshoot an installation. I have provided an example using Ubuntu LTS; these entries should be similar for other Debian based distributions.</p>

<hr />

<p>First edit the grub.cfg file, and modify (hd1,2) according to your drive and partition number.</p>

<p><code>nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code></p>
