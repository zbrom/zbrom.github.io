I"ƒ<p>This tutorial is has been tested on an Arch Linux system.  If you are not an Arch user, it should still work for your distro; the main difference is that you will need to use your distroâ€™s package manager instead of pacman.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you currently do not have this package installed, download it</p>

<p><code>pacman -S grub-bios</code></p>

<p>Install grub to your USB device MBR (replace sdX, with your device, eg: sda, sdb, â€¦ etc.)</p>

<p><code>grub-install --recheck /dev/sdX</code></p>

<p>Then generate your grub.cfg file with this command (You may or may not need to initially create the boot folder on your USB device).</p>

<p><code>grub-mkconfig -o /[path to your device]/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code></p>

<p>Download your favorite LiveCD ISO (eg: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).</p>

<p>Extract the ISO to a folder (e.g. name it ubuntu (inside there should be boot, casper, dists, â€¦ etc.))</p>

<p>Copy the ubuntu folder to the root of your flash drive (do NOT put it inside the boot folder on the USB).</p>

<p><code>cp ubuntu /[path to your device]/ubuntu</code></p>

<p>Navigate to /[path to your device]/boot/grub to edit your grub.cfg with a text editor.</p>

<p><code>nano /[path to your device]/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code></p>

<p>Modify the grub.cfg file accordingly (for Ubuntu it should look exactly like this example; feel free to generate additional enteries manually.</p>
