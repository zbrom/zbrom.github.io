<p>The SNA acceleration method causes tearing for some people. To fix this, enable the “TearFree” option in the driver by adding the following line to your configuration file:</p>

<p>nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf</p>

<h4 id="firefox-configuration-optional">Firefox Configuration (optional):</h4>

<p>Previously, force enabling hardware acceleration in Firefox was necessary.  Only enable this if you are noticing an issue in FireFox after enabling TearFree for the Intel driver.</p>

<p>Type about:config into the address bar in Firefox</p>

<p>Search for layers.acceleration.force-enabled</p>

<p>Change the Value from false to true</p>

<p>Restart Firefox</p>
