I"»<p>tmux is a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session.  It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the Unix shell that started the program.  It provides much of the same functionality as GNU Screen, but is distributed under a BSD license.</p>

<p>I have found tmux very useful with my raspberry pi.  It provides me with the capability to start an application, end an SSH session, then return to that application later (e.g. bfgminer).</p>

<h4 id="remove-swap">Remove Swap</h4>

<p>If you previously had a swap partition, ensure it is turned off</p>

<p><code>sudo swapoff -a</code></p>

<p>Remove your particular cryptswap partition.</p>

<p><code>sudo cryptsetup remove /dev/mapper/cryptswap1</code></p>

<p>Remove your logical volume.</p>

<p><code>lvremove /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01</code></p>

<h4 id="resize-volumes">Resize Volumes</h4>

<p>Display the size of your logical volume(s)</p>

<p><code>lvdisplay | grep Size</code></p>

<p>If desired, feel free to resize a logical volume (choose your desired size e.g. 50G)</p>

<p><code>lvresize /dev/VolGroup/LogVol00 --size 50G</code></p>

<p>Resize your physical volume to match the logical volume (choose your desired size e.g. 50G)</p>

<p><code>pvresize /dev/sda2 --setphysicalvolumesize 50G</code></p>

<h4 id="display-volume-sizes">Display Volume Sizes</h4>

<p>Display the size of your logical volume(s)</p>

<p><code>lvdisplay | grep Size</code></p>

<p>Display the PV sizes in SECTORS and take note of the smaller PSize:</p>

<p><code>lvm pvs --units s</code></p>

<p>Display the partition Size in SECTORS using parted and take note of the Start sector and partition Number of the partition with ‚Äúlvm‚Äù in the Flags column (I recommend you save the full output of the following command):</p>

<p><code>parted /dev/sda unit s print</code></p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong><span style="background-color: #ff0000; color: #ffffff;">POINT OF NO RETURN ‚Äì HAVE BACKUPS</span></strong></p>
</div>

<p>Now we need to nuke the old, large partition from the partition table, and immediately recreate it with the exact same Start sector, but with a newer, shorter End sector. To calculate the new End sector, ADD the partition Start sector to the PV PSize, and then add a safety margin of around 131072 sectors (64MB) to that.  When I attempted this, it required my to do five times this amount (655360 sectors).  The number 2 should correspond to your particular lvm partition.  Again, make sure your data is backed up.</p>

<p>parted /dev/sda rm 2</p>

<p>Recreate it smaller + safety margin (as explained above). NOTE: remember to append the letter ‚Äús‚Äù to your values to qualify them as sectors. (e.g. ‚Äú131072s‚Äù)</p>

<p>parted /dev/sda mkpart primary 401625s 105390297s
parted /dev/sda set 2 lvm on
parted /dev/sda print
fdisk -l /dev/sda</p>

<p>Hopefully this offers some clarification of how to accomplish this cumbersome task.  For further information, check out these references.</p>
