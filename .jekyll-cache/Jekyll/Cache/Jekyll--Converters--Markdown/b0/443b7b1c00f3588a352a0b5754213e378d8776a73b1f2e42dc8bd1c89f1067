I"q<p>tmux is a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session.  It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the Unix shell that started the program.  It provides much of the same functionality as GNU Screen, but is distributed under a BSD license.</p>

<p>I have found tmux very useful with my raspberry pi.  It provides me with the capability to start an application, end an SSH session, then return to that application later (e.g. bfgminer).</p>
