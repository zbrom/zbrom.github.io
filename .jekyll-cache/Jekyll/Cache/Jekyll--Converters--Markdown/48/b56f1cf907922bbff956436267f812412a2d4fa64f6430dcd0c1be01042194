I"%<p>While Google Drive claims to be secure with encryption, all of your uploaded files are stored on their servers with Google Drive’s server side encryption.  Google still has access to your data and maintains control of your encryption keys.  Companies such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Apple iCloud all have permission to access your data.  This guide will help those looking for private, secure, and encrypted alternatives.  For additional security, it is recommended to encrypt files using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EncFS" target="_blank">EncFS</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ECryptfs" target="_blank">eCryptfs</a>, or <a href="https://veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html" target="_blank">VeraCrypt</a> prior to uploading to the cloud.  For best security, consider self-hosting your data.</p>
