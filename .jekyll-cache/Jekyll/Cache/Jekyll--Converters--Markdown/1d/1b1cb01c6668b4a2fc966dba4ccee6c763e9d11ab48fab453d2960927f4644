I"<p>So there are many reasons why you may want to encrypt your root partition and you must have one if you are looking here.</p>

<p>There are a million different ways you could set up your partition scheme. I’m just going to show you one way here. I’m going to assume you have a decent amount of experience with Linux because encryption and Arch Linux are not for n00bs.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ff0000; color: #ffffff;">WARNING!<br />
FOLLOWING THIS TUTORIAL COULD RESULT IN MASSIVE LOSE OF DATA. ALWAYS BACKUP FIRST.</span></div>

<p>As stated above you should always backup up data. Data that you have on drives that you are about to encrypt will be completely destroyed.First you want to find the drive you want to install to so run.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<p><code>fdisk -l</code></p>

<p>This is the output on my system.</p>

<p>Lets say the drive you want to install to is /dev/sda. You would want to write random data to this drive if it is a HDD. This will destroy all data.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<p>dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=512</p>

<p>The block size should be equal to your physical sector size for greatest performance when running this command. Be patient because this could potentially take hours depending on processor performance, disk size, and disk write speeds.</p>

<p>If you are using an SSD you will kill its performance by writing random data to it this way. Instead you should zero out the drive.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ff0000; color: #ffffff;">Note: This could potentially expose what type of filesytem that resides in the encrypted container to an attacker.</span></div>

<p>Code:</p>

<p>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512</p>

<p>The next step is to partition the disk. There are many programs that you use to do this. I assume you know how so I won’t go into great detail here. Create two primary partitions on the drive. Make the first one 256 MB. The second one will take the rest of the drive up.</p>

<p>You should now have two partitions on the drive. Format the 256 MB partition. This partition will be made for /boot.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<p>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1</p>

<p>Next I am going to show how to make an encrypted volume. Set a passphrase that is super secure. I recommend using a short password with a yubikey static password. You can get a yubikey <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<p>cryptsetup -y -s 512 -c aes-xts-plain luksFormat /dev/sda2</p>

<p>For drives larger than 2 TB you should use aes-xts-plain64.</p>

<p>Now that you have an encrypted volume you must open this volume and give it a device mapper name.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<p>cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 encrypted</p>

<p>If you want to be able to create more than one partition inside of your encrypted volume you will want to create an LVM. I will show how to create a partition for a 20GB root and the rest for /home. I will also show you how to format the new logical volumes.</p>

<p>Code:
pvcreate /dev/mapper/encrypted</p>

<p>vgcreate vg_name /dev/mapper/encrypted</p>

<p>lvcreate -n root -L 20G vg_name</p>

<p>lvcreate -n home -l 100%FREE vg_name</p>

<p>vgchange -ay
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg_name-root
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg_name-home</p>

<p>From this point you would go about the Arch install, following the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide" target="_blank">Arch Installation Guide</a>, with a few modifications that I will show. It is import that we tell the kernel where the root partition is and what parititon must be unlocked.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<p>blkid /dev/sda2</p>

<p>The output should be something like the following. I have highlighted the important part.</p>
