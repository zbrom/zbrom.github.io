I"Œ<p>FOSS app of the day: NewPipe! Found a Free and Open Source YouTube alternative app that is pretty awesome. You can run the app without a Google account or Google Play Services. You can still subscribe to channels, only that data will be stored locally on your phone instead of being tied to your Google Account. Additionally, you can download any YouTube video from the app to your phone.</p>
