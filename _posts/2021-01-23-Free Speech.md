Welcome to ghorr.org!  This is an unprecedented time where free speech is being blatantly targeted by Big Tech.  Now, the CEO of Mozilla is promoting that [more that deplatforming must be done](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/we-need-more-than-deplatforming/){:target="_blank"}!  Rhetoric like this is incredibly dangerous to free speech.  ghorr is recommending you to consider alternative platforms for your internet browser that do not promote silencing free speech.  Brave Browser is an excellent option to consider, which is based on Chromium, but includes a built in ad blocker and cryptocurrency payment payment system.  Brave is trying to create a safer, faster, and better browsing experience, while allowing direct payments to content creators, utilizing Basic Attention Token cryptocurrency.  Check out Brave on Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS.
