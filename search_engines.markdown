Google is one of the largest offenders when it comes to privacy.  Google makes money off of your data, through massive collection of every interaction you have while using their services.  All of your data is being logged, sold to third parties, and even be handed over to government agencies.  The process of deGoogling your life can be an arduous task.  ghorr will help in aleviating some of the difficulty in order to help you regain control of your data, and finding secure alternative platforms for your data.  Every step you take, brings you closer to restoring your digital freedom.
